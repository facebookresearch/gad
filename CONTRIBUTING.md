# Contributing to GAD

We welcome contributions and want to make contributing to this project as easy and
transparent as possible.

## Pull Requests

Every pull request should have a description that motivates it and should have tests that
cover all of the source lines touched and added by the request.

No pull request will be merged unless all tests are passing.

The person approving a pull request will also merge it into master.

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")

In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is clear and has
sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process outlined on
that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style

We rely on `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` to ensure consistent formatting and enforce
common style rules.

A TODO comment should include the number of an issue that describes the outstanding work
in greater detail.

New public APIs should be
[documented](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html).

Additional guidelines may be found in the [Rust style
guide](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/fmt-rfcs/blob/master/guide/guide.md) and in
the [Rust API guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/checklist.html).
